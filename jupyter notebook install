# 🧠 How to Install and Run Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu

This guide explains how to **install and run Jupyter Notebook** on Ubuntu using different methods — either with `pip` or via **Anaconda**.

---

## ⚙️ Option 1: Install Using pip (Recommended)

### Step 1: Update System Packages
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
````

### Step 2: Install Python and pip

Make sure Python 3 and pip are installed:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

### Step 3: Install Jupyter Notebook

```bash
pip install notebook
```

### Step 4: Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your web browser automatically:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

---

## 🧱 Option 2: Install via Anaconda (Alternative)

### Step 1: Download Anaconda Installer

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

```bash
bash Anaconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts and then restart your terminal.

### Step 3: Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

## 🧩 Optional: Create a Shortcut or Alias

To make launching Jupyter easier:

```bash
echo "alias jn='jupyter notebook'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can simply start it by typing:

```bash
jn
```

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

### 🔹 Command Not Found

If you get an error like `command not found: jupyter`, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install notebook
```

### 🔹 Virtual Environment Setup (Optional)

If you prefer an isolated environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install notebook
```

---

## 💻 Run Jupyter in VS Code (Optional)

You can also use **VS Code** for an integrated notebook experience:

1. Install the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions in VS Code.
2. Open a `.ipynb` file or create a new one.
3. Select your Python interpreter.
4. Start coding interactively!

Would you like me to include a **“Screenshots” section** (with placeholders like `/images/jupyter_home.png`) so you can later upload terminal or browser screenshots to your GitHub README?
